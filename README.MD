# Interactive Dashboard for Momentum Strategy Evaluation with GANs 

## What it is about?
<strong>This dashboard compares the quality of generated cumulative log 
returns for five stocks from the Moscow Exchange, evaluated using the 
C-FID metric.</strong> It also shows how momentum strategy performs with 
different parameters <strong>n finish</strong> and <strong>n start</strong>
 on train period of real data and on generated data, which allows to compare 
 optimal parameter sets, in terms of <strong>Sharpe Ratio</strong>. The GAN 
 architectures employedâ€”<strong>TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)</strong>, 
 <strong>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)</strong>, and <strong>GRU 
 (Gated Recurrent Unit)</strong>.
